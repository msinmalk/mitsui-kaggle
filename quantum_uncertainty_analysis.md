# Quantum Uncertainty Quantification for Commodity Prediction

## Overview

This document outlines the potential for using quantum computing (IBM Qiskit) to improve uncertainty quantification in commodity price prediction, addressing the fundamental signal-to-noise problem in financial markets.

## The Signal-to-Noise Problem

### Classical Challenge
- **High-dimensional data**: 1000+ features, 424 targets
- **Noisy signals**: Market volatility, sentiment, algorithmic trading
- **Uncertainty propagation**: Traditional ML models struggle with uncertainty quantification
- **Correlation complexity**: Cross-asset relationships are non-linear and time-varying

### Quantum Opportunity
- **Natural uncertainty encoding**: Quantum superposition represents multiple states simultaneously
- **High-dimensional optimization**: Quantum algorithms excel in high-dimensional spaces
- **Parallel scenario exploration**: Quantum circuits can explore multiple market scenarios
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Quantum measurements provide natural confidence intervals

## Proposed Quantum Approaches

### 1. Quantum Variational Circuits (QVC)

```python
# Conceptual implementation
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.algorithms import VQE
from qiskit.opflow import PauliSumOp
import numpy as np

class QuantumUncertaintyModel:
    def __init__(self, n_qubits=8, n_layers=3):
        self.n_qubits = n_qubits
        self.n_layers = n_layers
        self.circuit = self._build_circuit()
    
    def _build_circuit(self):
        """Build variational quantum circuit for uncertainty modeling"""
        qc = QuantumCircuit(self.n_qubits)
        
        # Feature encoding layer
        for i in range(self.n_qubits):
            qc.ry(np.pi/4, i)  # Encode features as rotation angles
        
        # Variational layers
        for layer in range(self.n_layers):
            # Entangling gates
            for i in range(self.n_qubits-1):
                qc.cx(i, i+1)
            
            # Parameterized rotations
            for i in range(self.n_qubits):
                qc.ry(f'Î¸_{layer}_{i}', i)
        
        return qc
    
    def predict_with_uncertainty(self, features):
        """Predict with quantum uncertainty quantification"""
        # Encode features into quantum state
        # Run variational circuit
        # Measure uncertainty from quantum state
        pass
```

### 2. Quantum Monte Carlo for Uncertainty Sampling

```python
def quantum_monte_carlo_sampling(features, n_samples=1000):
    """
    Use quantum circuits to sample from complex probability distributions
    representing market uncertainty
    """
    # Encode market state into quantum superposition
    # Use quantum interference to explore uncertainty space
    # Sample multiple scenarios simultaneously
    pass
```

### 3. Hybrid Classical-Quantum Pipeline

```python
class HybridQuantumModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.classical_model = None  # XGBoost, LightGBM
        self.quantum_uncertainty = None  # Qiskit uncertainty model
    
    def train(self, X, y):
        # Train classical model for point predictions
        self.classical_model.fit(X, y)
        
        # Train quantum model for uncertainty quantification
        self.quantum_uncertainty = QuantumUncertaintyModel()
        self.quantum_uncertainty.train(X, y)
    
    def predict_with_uncertainty(self, X):
        # Get point prediction from classical model
        prediction = self.classical_model.predict(X)
        
        # Get uncertainty from quantum model
        uncertainty = self.quantum_uncertainty.predict_uncertainty(X)
        
        return prediction, uncertainty
```
